Problem 1: gss_cats
```{r}
library(forcats)
help("gss_cat") # Reading help page of the gss_cat data frame 
```
i. The variables in gss_cat are:
year: the year of the survey
age: the age of the respondent
marital: marital status
race: the race of the respondent
sex: the sex of the respondent
rincome: reported income
partyid: party affiliation
relig: religion
denom: denomination
tvhours: hours per day watching tv

```{r}
# find class of gss_cat
class(gss_cat)
```
ii. The class of gss_cat is "data.frame"

```{r}
# to find class of each variable 
sapply(gss_cat, class)
```

```{r}
#  reorder the levels of the "relig" variable in alphabetical order
gss_cat2 <- gss_cat %>%

}

print(fib3[n]) #prints 30th number
```

# Calculate the log2 of the 100th Fibonacci number

```

# Calculate the log2 of the 100th Fibonacci number
log2_fib <- log2(fib[100])
print(log2_fib)

# Check if the log2 of the 100th Fibonacci number is roughly 67.57
if (round(log2_fib, 2) == 67.57) {

Problem 7: OpenIntro Marijuana
```{r}

Problem 8: ex0330 dataset
```{r}
library(Sleuth3)
data(ex0330)
str(ex0330)
```

```{r}
mean_educ <- mean(ex0330$Educ)
sd_educ <- sd(ex0330$Educ)
mean_income <- mean(ex0330$Income2005)
sd_income <- sd(ex0330$Income2005)

print(mean_educ)
print(sd_educ)
print(mean_income)
print(sd_income)
```


```{r}
# calculate confidence intervals
ci_educ <- t.test(ex0330$Educ)$conf.int
ci_income <- t.test(ex0330$Income2005)$conf.int
print(ci_educ)
print(ci_income)
```
Confidence intervals interpretation: The confidence interval for Educ is ( 13.05, 13.23) and the confidence interval for Income2005 is (43966.76, 48629.26). This means that we are 95% confident that the true mean of Educ falls between 13.05 and 13.23, and the true mean of Income2005 falls between 43966.76 and 48629.26.

```{r}
# calculate the range of values for both variables
range_educ <- range(ex0330$Educ)
range_income <- range(ex0330$Income2005)
print(range_educ)
print(range_income)
```
Range estimates: The range for Educ is 12 to 16, and the range for Income2005 is 200 to 519340. This means that the values of number of years of education range from 12 to 16, and the values of Income range from 200 to 519340.

```{r}
# plot data to see
plot(ex0330$Educ, ex0330$Income2005, xlab = "Educ", ylab = "Income2005")
```

```{r}
# now let's look at correlation
correlation <- cor(ex0330$Educ, ex0330$Income2005)
print(correlation)
```
This means that there is a positive but moderate relationship between the two variables. This suggests that as the level of education increases, the income level tends to increase as well, but the relationship is not very strong.
